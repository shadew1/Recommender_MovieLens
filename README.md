# Recommender_MovieLens

# **Project Objective**

To analyse the MovieLens dataset and find what factors truly influence movie ratings and then create a simple movie recommender using Cosine Similarity. It also uses the API of TMDB to extract additional movie details from the TMDB website. The project is EDA focused, with a lot of weight on analysing each variable, visualisations, trends and distributions of features. A simple recommender using cosine similarity is created at the end.
